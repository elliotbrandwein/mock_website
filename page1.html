			Do not go gentle into that good night,
			Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
			Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

			Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
			Because their words had forked no lightning they
			Do not go gentle into that good night.

			Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
			Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
			Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

			Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
			And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
			Do not go gentle into that good night.

			Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
			Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
			Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

			And you, my father, there on the sad height,
			Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
			Do not go gentle into that good night.
			Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</div>

The Road Not Taken - Poem by Robert Frost
Autoplay next video

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim
Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
